# IFT2015-TP1
First TP of the class IFT2015.

In this TP, we are creating a Java program where it takes as input a text file containing information on an imaginary truck with its cargo capacity,
the number of cargos to deliver, as well as the geographical locations of different warehouses in longitude and latitude and the amount of cargo held
in each. With this, we aim to figure out the warehouse with the highest amount of cargo, which will be our starting point, and then figure out the
path that the truck will take while attempting to minimize lift distances.
